                    At Comcast, I worked as a Backend Engineer III and previously as an Engineer II, focusing on big data, stream processing, and data analytics. 
                    As a Backend Engineer III (Aug 2021 - Mar 2024), I played a key role in the Data Integration Engine, leveraging Apache Flink to analyze millions of real-time records and detect internet outages. This system enabled proactive and reactive solutions, ensuring customers received assistance before needing to reach out.

By integrating Redis, I collected real-time metrics such as packet loss and latency, offering a snapshot of a user's network state.

I also contributed to Elements UI, a React application designed for non-technical partners to ingest diverse data into our timeline system. Furthermore, I developed machine learning models in Databricks (Python) to generate customer solution recommendations. These models were processed by Apache Flink and delivered to end users, enhancing the support experience.

One of my key contributions was building the Provider Finder Tool, which allowed consumers to search for hospitals and doctors and save their preferred providers for future reference.

                Hey there! My name is Muneeb Haq, and I have been programming professionally since August of 2015. I got my start in the world of computer science at a very young age. It began with me tinkering around with Warcraft III custom maps, which eventually turned into an effort to learn how to make my own video games. This led me to computer science, and it has been a deeply gratifying journey ever since.

              <p className="text-md  text-stone-700">
                While my origins were rooted in a desire to get into game development, my true passion for creation and learning has allowed me to experience many different facets of this field. I started my career as a UI developer making healthcare websites used by millions. Over time, I transitioned into a variety of different roles, ranging from middleware service development and DevOps infrastructure to big data real-time analytics and processing.

                            I still hold that original flame deep in my heart for game development and 3D graphics programming, albeit not in a professional capacity. Many of my side projects and passions revolve around creating games and 3D experiences in WebGL, for example. However, I try not to limit myself to just 3D applications and always seek to explore new languages and paradigms.
